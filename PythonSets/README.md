            <h2>Sets</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.</li>
                <li>Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.</li>
                <li>A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.</li>
                <strong>* Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.</strong>
                <li>Sets are written with curly brackets.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Access Items</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You cannot access items in a set by referring to an index or a key.</li>
                <li>But you can loop through the set items using a <code>for</code> loop, or ask if a specified value is present in a set, by using the <code>in</code> keyword.</li>
            </ul>
