            <h2>Python For Loops</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A <code>for</code> loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).</li>
                <li>This is less like the <code>for</code> keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.</li>
                <li>With the <code>for</code> loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.</li>
            </ul>
