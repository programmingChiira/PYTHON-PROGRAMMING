            <p>An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values.</p>
            <p>An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values.</p>
            <p>Technically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol, which consist of the methods <code>__iter__()</code> and <code>__next__()</code> .<p>

                <h2>Iterator vs Iterable</h2>
                <p>Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all iterable objects. They are iterable containers which you can get an iterator from.</p>
                <p>All these objects have a <code>iter()</code> method which is used to get an iterator:</p>
